# Linear
You need a way to incrementally verify & release a simple application.

**How should you get started?**

Use a simple linear pipeline. This is a “textbook” pattern that is a simple way to illustrate the concept of continuous delivery, and works quite well for simple applications. However, if your project is non-trivial, requiring a lot of different phases of testing or support for testing multiple related applications (as is the case with microservices) than at some point you will likely outgrow this pattern.
