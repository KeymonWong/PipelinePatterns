# VCS Labeling

You want a simple version label that isn't tied to your pipeline tools.

** How can you create a version label that isn't tied to your pipelines? **

An alternative to pipeline counter labeling is to use your version control system as a counter. This advantage is that this is simple and doesn't couple you to any particular tool for implementing pipelines.

This works well for version control systems with sequential revision numbers, like SVN, but may be less useful with non-sequential systems like git.
